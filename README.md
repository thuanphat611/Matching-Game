### Introduction
The Matching Game (commonly known as Pikachu Puzzle Game) includes a board of multiple cells, each of which presents a figure. The player finds and matches a pair of cells that contain the same figure and connect each other in some particular pattern. A legal match will make the two cells disappear. The game ends when all matching pairs are found. the figure below shows some snapshots from the Pikachu Puzzle Game. In this project, we will develop a simplified version of this Matching Game by remaking the game with characters (instead of figures).
